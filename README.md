# Top-K Diversity Regularizer

This project is a pytorch implementation of Top-ùëò Diversity Regularization for Aggregately Diversified Recommender Systems.
This paper proposes a novel approach, Top-ùëò Diversity Regularization (TDR), to achieve high aggregate level diversity in recommendation system while maintaining accuracy.
This project provides executable source code with adjustable hyperparameters as arguments and preprocessed datasets which used in the paper.
